# Lab 11 — Measurement System Analysis and Gage R&R

**DMAIC phase:** MEASURE  |  **Lab type:** Core  |  **Course:** Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (CLSSGB) Training (TGS-2025055775)

## Objective

Prove the measurement system is trustworthy before trusting the data (A4).

## Scenario

Northwind Retail Distribution Centre fulfils online orders from a 12,000 sqm warehouse. Customers are complaining about late deliveries and the company is receiving negative feedback on social media. The Distribution Manager has asked you, as Green Belt, to lead a DMAIC project on the order-fulfilment process — from order release to carrier handover.

## What you will build

An attribute Gage R&R study with repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy percentages.

**Tools and techniques:** MSA, components of variation, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, resolution, Gage R&R acceptance

## Data for this lab

Open the workbook(s) below from this lab's `data/` folder. Every lab uses the same Northwind baseline month, so the figures reconcile across the whole course.

- **[`lab11-gage-rr-attribute.xlsx`](data/lab11-gage-rr-attribute.xlsx)** — 30 order records classified as On time / Late by three appraisers, twice each, against the known correct attribute. The raw input to the agreement calculations.

**Working with `lab11-gage-rr-attribute.xlsx`:**

- Repeatability (per appraiser) = % of samples where that appraiser agreed with THEMSELVES.
- Reproducibility = % of samples where ALL THREE appraisers agreed with each other.
- Accuracy = % where the appraiser matched the Known Correct column.
- One appraiser is materially worse than the others — identify who, and say what you would fix.

## Steps

### Step 1

Draw the components of variation tree: total observed variation = actual process variation + measurement system variation.

### Step 2

Split measurement variation into its parts — repeatability (one appraiser, repeated measures) and reproducibility (between appraisers).

### Step 3

Check resolution first using the ten-bucket rule: the measurement device must resolve to about one tenth of the tolerance you need to detect.

### Step 4

Set up an attribute Gage R&R: take at least 20 sample records, label them opaquely so appraisers cannot recognise them, and record the known correct attribute for each.

### Step 5

Open lab11-gage-rr-attribute.xlsx — 30 order records already classified On time/Late by three appraisers, twice each, against the known correct attribute.

### Step 6

Repeat the exercise with the sample order randomised so appraisers cannot recall their first answer.

### Step 7

Calculate repeatability per appraiser from the workbook: the percentage of the 30 samples where that appraiser agreed with THEMSELVES across both trials.

### Step 8

Calculate reproducibility: the percentage of samples where all appraisers agreed with each other.

### Step 9

Calculate accuracy: the percentage where each appraiser matched the known correct attribute.

### Step 10

Apply the acceptance criteria — a system agreeing only around 50% of the time is not fit for use. Record what must be fixed: the operational definition, training or the device.

## Check your work

You can state your repeatability, reproducibility and accuracy percentages and give a clear go/no-go verdict on whether the measurement system can be trusted.

## Deliverable

Save your output — it forms part of your Northwind improvement package and is your revision material for the assessment.
