# Lab 2 — Y = f(X), Sigma Level, DPMO and the DMAIC Roadmap

**DMAIC phase:** FOUNDATIONS  |  **Lab type:** Core  |  **Course:** Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (CLSSGB) Training (TGS-2025055775)

## Objective

Express the problem as Y = f(X) and calculate the baseline sigma level (K1, A4).

## Scenario

Northwind Retail Distribution Centre fulfils online orders from a 12,000 sqm warehouse. Customers are complaining about late deliveries and the company is receiving negative feedback on social media. The Distribution Manager has asked you, as Green Belt, to lead a DMAIC project on the order-fulfilment process — from order release to carrier handover.

## What you will build

A Y = f(X) statement, a DPMO calculation and a baseline sigma level.

**Tools and techniques:** Y = f(X) model, DPU, DPO, DPMO, sigma level, DMAIC tollgates

## Data for this lab

Open the workbook(s) below from this lab's `data/` folder. Every lab uses the same Northwind baseline month, so the figures reconcile across the whole course.

- **[`lab02-baseline-defect-summary.xlsx`](data/lab02-baseline-defect-summary.xlsx)** — The monthly baseline used to calculate the defect rate, DPMO and sigma level. These are the exact figures quoted in the assessment.

**Working with `lab02-baseline-defect-summary.xlsx`:**

- Defect rate = 357 / 4200 = 0.085 (8.5%).
- DPMO = (defects / (units x opportunities)) x 1,000,000.
- Read the resulting DPMO against the sigma conversion table in labs/tools.md.

## Steps

### Step 1

Write the project Y — the single output metric the customer feels. For Northwind: order fulfilment lead time, or percentage of orders shipped on time.

### Step 2

Brainstorm at least eight candidate Xs — the process inputs that could drive that Y (picking method, staffing, slotting, system downtime, order profile, shift, carrier cut-off).

### Step 3

Write the relationship formally as Y = f(X1, X2, ... Xn) and state which Xs you can control and which you cannot.

### Step 4

Open lab02-baseline-defect-summary.xlsx: 4,200 orders shipped last month, 357 of them late. Calculate the defect rate as a proportion.

### Step 5

Calculate DPMO using DPMO = (defects / (units x opportunities per unit)) x 1,000,000. Treat each order as one opportunity for a late-delivery defect.

### Step 6

Look up the resulting DPMO on the sigma conversion table to read off the baseline sigma level.

### Step 7

Map the five DMAIC phases against your project and name the tollgate deliverable that ends each phase.

## Check your work

Your Y is a measurable customer-facing output, you have at least eight Xs, and your DPMO and sigma level are calculated from the 357/4,200 baseline.

## Deliverable

Save your output — it forms part of your Northwind improvement package and is your revision material for the assessment.
