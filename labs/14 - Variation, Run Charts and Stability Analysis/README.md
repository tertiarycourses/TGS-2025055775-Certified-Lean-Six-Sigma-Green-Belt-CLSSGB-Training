# Lab 14 — Variation, Run Charts and Stability Analysis

**DMAIC phase:** ANALYZE  |  **Lab type:** Core  |  **Course:** Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (CLSSGB) Training (TGS-2025055775)

## Objective

Distinguish common cause from special cause variation using run charts (A3).

## Scenario

Northwind Retail Distribution Centre fulfils online orders from a 12,000 sqm warehouse. Customers are complaining about late deliveries and the company is receiving negative feedback on social media. The Distribution Manager has asked you, as Green Belt, to lead a DMAIC project on the order-fulfilment process — from order release to carrier handover.

## What you will build

A run chart of the baseline data with the six non-random patterns assessed.

**Tools and techniques:** Common vs special cause, run chart, median line, trend, shift, cluster, mixture, oscillation, bias

## Data for this lab

Open the workbook(s) below from this lab's `data/` folder. Every lab uses the same Northwind baseline month, so the figures reconcile across the whole course.

- **[`lab14-daily-mean-lead-time.xlsx`](data/lab14-daily-mean-lead-time.xlsx)** — Mean lead time and late count for each of the 30 days of the baseline month, in time order — the input to the run chart and stability analysis.

**Working with `lab14-daily-mean-lead-time.xlsx`:**

- Plot in TIME ORDER — never sort this data.
- Draw the median line, then test for trend (6+), shift (8+), clustering, mixture, oscillation (14+) and bias.
- State whether the process is stable (common cause only) or unstable (special causes present).

## Steps

### Step 1

Open lab14-daily-mean-lead-time.xlsx and plot the 30 daily means in time order — time order matters, so never sort this data.

### Step 2

Draw the median line through the plotted points.

### Step 3

Test for a TREND: six or more consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing.

### Step 4

Test for a SHIFT: eight or more consecutive points on the same side of the median, indicating the process level changed.

### Step 5

Test for CLUSTERING: groups of points bunched together, suggesting a batch or intermittent effect.

### Step 6

Test for MIXTURES: points avoiding the median line, which usually means two different processes are being plotted as one.

### Step 7

Test for OSCILLATION: fourteen or more points alternating up and down, often over-adjustment by operators.

### Step 8

Test for BIAS: too few or too many runs above and below the median compared with what randomness would produce.

### Step 9

Classify your process: stable with common cause variation only, or unstable with special causes present.

### Step 10

If special causes are present, investigate and record what changed at that point in time before proceeding — an unstable process cannot be meaningfully capable.

### Step 11

Explain the tampering trap: adjusting a stable process in response to common cause variation always increases variation.

## Check your work

You can state whether your process is stable, name every non-random pattern you tested for, and explain what tampering is and why it makes things worse.

## Deliverable

Save your output — it forms part of your Northwind improvement package and is your revision material for the assessment.
