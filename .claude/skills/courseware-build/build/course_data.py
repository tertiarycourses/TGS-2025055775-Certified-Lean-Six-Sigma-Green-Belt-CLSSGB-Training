SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (CLSSGB) Training.

Content is grounded in three references (see reference/):
  * "WSQ - Dr. Alfred Ang - Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (CLSSGB)
    Training - v21.pptx" — the original 387-slide trainer deck. Its teaching
    diagrams are imported into courseware/assets/diagrams/ and shown verbatim so
    formulas are reproduced exactly as the trainer taught them.
  * "Six Sigma: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide" — The Council for Six Sigma
    Certification (CSSC), July 2018 edition. The CSSC scopes the belts by
    chapter: Yellow Belt = Ch 1-11, GREEN BELT = Ch 1-24. Everything in
    Ch 12-24 (MSA/Gage R&R, distributions, correlation & regression, hypothesis
    testing, sample size, control charts, capability) is therefore Green-Belt
    material and is taught here in depth.
  * The v5 assessment papers (WA SAQ + PP) — the course is built backwards from
    what is actually assessed, so students who complete it can pass.

STEP UP FROM YELLOW BELT
------------------------
The Yellow Belt (TGS-2025053922) supports a project; the Green Belt LEADS one and
owns the statistics. Every DMAIC phase below therefore carries the Yellow Belt
tool PLUS its Green Belt statistical counterpart:
    Define   : charter -> + Kano, affinity, CTQ trees, stakeholder/RACI
    Measure  : check sheet -> + MSA/Gage R&R, sampling theory, sample size, capability
    Analyze  : 5 Whys/Pareto -> + hypothesis testing, p-values, correlation, regression
    Improve  : brainstorm -> + solution selection matrix, FMEA/RPN, DOE, piloting
    Control  : control plan -> + SPC, control chart selection, Cp/Cpk, out-of-control rules

Every artifact (PPT, LP, LG, LG.md, labs index, assessment) is generated from this
module + data_domainN.py so they stay 100% aligned.
