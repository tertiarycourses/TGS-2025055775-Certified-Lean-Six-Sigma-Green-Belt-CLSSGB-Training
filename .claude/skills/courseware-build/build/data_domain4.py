Domain 4 — The IMPROVE phase.

Labs 19-22. The Yellow Belt suggests improvements; the Green Belt SELECTS them
against weighted criteria, RISK-ASSESSES them with FMEA before they go live, and
PILOTS them against the measured baseline before committing.

Lab 21 (solution selection matrix) maps directly to PP Assessment Task 2 (A3).
