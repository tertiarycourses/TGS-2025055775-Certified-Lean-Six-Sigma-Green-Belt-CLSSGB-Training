"""Build the CLSSGB slide deck — all-white Tertiary house style, DMAIC order.

Structure:
  Cover -> Admin (TRAQOM, trainers x2, ground rules, LMS, lesson plan x4 days,
  TSC, outcomes, course outline, briefing, assessment, assessment flow, practice exam)
  -> Foundations -> D -> M -> A -> I -> C  (each phase: concept slides then its labs)
  -> Wrap-up -> TRAQOM -> Certificate -> Assessment -> Assessment Flow -> Digital Attendance -> Thank You

Content comes entirely from course_data.py + data_domainN.py + concepts.py so the
