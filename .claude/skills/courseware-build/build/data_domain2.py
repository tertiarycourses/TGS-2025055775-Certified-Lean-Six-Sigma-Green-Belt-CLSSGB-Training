Domain 2 — The MEASURE phase.

Labs 7-13. This is where the Green Belt clearly departs from the Yellow Belt: the
Yellow Belt fills in a check sheet, the Green Belt proves the measurement system is
trustworthy (MSA/Gage R&R), calculates how much data is enough (sample size), and
converts the baseline into a capability index.

Formulas used here are reproduced from the original v21 trainer deck, not invented:
    Sample size (continuous)  n = (1.96s / d)^2
    DPMO                      (defects / (units x opportunities)) x 1,000,000
    Takt time                 available working time / customer demand
