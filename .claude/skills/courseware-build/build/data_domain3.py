Domain 3 — The ANALYZE phase.

Labs 14-18. The statistical heart of the Green Belt. The Yellow Belt asserts a root
cause from a Fishbone; the Green Belt PROVES it with a hypothesis test and quantifies
the relationship with correlation and regression.

Decision rules used here come from the CSSC handbook and the v21 trainer deck:
    p < alpha            -> reject H0, accept Ha
    alpha = 0.05         -> 95% confidence
    |R| >= 0.4           -> correlation is considered to occur
    r^2                  -> proportion of variation in Y explained by X
