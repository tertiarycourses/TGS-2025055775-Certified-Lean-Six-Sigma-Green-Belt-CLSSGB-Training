  "It follows the DMAIC roadmap end to end — Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control — and provides "
  "step-by-step instructions for every hands-on lab. Core labs are assessed; elective labs are provided "
  "as additional practice and are run when time allows.")

  "are shipping late and customers are complaining. By the end of the course your lab outputs form a "
