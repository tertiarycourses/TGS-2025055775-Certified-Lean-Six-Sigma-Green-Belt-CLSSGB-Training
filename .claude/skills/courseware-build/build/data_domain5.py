Domain 5 — The CONTROL phase and project closure.

Labs 23-25. The Yellow Belt writes a simple control plan; the Green Belt builds
STATISTICAL process control — selects the correct control chart for the data type,
calculates the limits, applies the out-of-control rules, and proves the improvement
held with a re-measured capability index.

Lab 24 (control plan) maps directly to PP Assessment Task 3 (A4, A5).
