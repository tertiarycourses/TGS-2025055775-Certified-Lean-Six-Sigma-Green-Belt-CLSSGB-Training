Domain 1 — Foundations and the DEFINE phase.

Labs 1-6. Every lab uses the SAME running scenario as the PP assessment — the
Northwind Retail Distribution Centre order-fulfilment process — so the courseware
and the assessment are one continuous story. A Green Belt LEADS these activities;
the Yellow Belt only contributed to them.

Grounded in the CSSC "Six Sigma: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide" (Ch 1-11 for the
foundations, Ch 12+ for Green Belt depth) and the original v21 trainer deck.
